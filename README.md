A WordPress website hosted on a cloud-based LAMP server

An AWS cloud-based LAMP server was built to host a website. The website is centered around an operating system of choice, Zorin OS in this case, and includes a number of separate pages with information pertaining to the OS. The website has a domain name, contains WordPress plugins and widgets, and the ability to track website activity via a connected analytics server.
